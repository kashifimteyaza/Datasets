# Datasets
This dataset is a curated subset extracted from the primary CoT dataset [Kim et al., 2023], comprising 400,000 rows. It was created by preprocessing and concatenating relevant data from 13 selected datasets related to academics and knowledge. The curated dataset underwent further processing to structure the data in an instruction/response format. I used this dataset for fine-tuning the Gemma-2b-it model to elicit Chain-of-Thought rationales for creating educational content for a diverse coherence of students.
